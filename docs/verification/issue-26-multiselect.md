# Issue #26 verification

Contract/scenarios: [implementation plan](../plans/issue-26-multiselect.md).

## Local evidence

- macOS with Node 22.21.1, temporary real SQLite databases and disposable source folders only.
- Initial public service and Table tests failed on unsupported MultiSelect creation and absent creation control, then passed after implementation.
- Focused service/IPC/EN/RU UI tests pass: stable sets, duplicate/foreign/type/extra-field rejection, source isolation, no-op ordering, shared options, local visibility, failure rollback, pending controls, retained drafts and sibling updates. Sparse arrays initially returned storage errors; a red regression now verifies rejection as invalid input before persistence. Existing Single Select scenarios remain passing.
- `npm run test:migrations`: 346 tests, 345 passed, one platform skip, zero failures. The first run found six stale migration-count/schema-inventory expectations; only the new count/table and typed rejection expectations were updated, retaining preservation and rejection assertions.
- Typecheck, lint, documentation links and whitespace checks passed on the local candidate.
- Development Electron smoke passed EN/RU with keyboard, invalid drafts, options/colors/order, hidden usages, multi-membership save, restart, clear, individual removal, source-sibling edits, stable project ID and unchanged folders/files. 1024/1440 captures show no page overflow; the narrow RU capture was visually inspected. Local evidence: `work/issue-26-multiselect-runtime/`.
- macOS package build and artifact check passed. The first packaged smoke completed English acceptance and encountered a 10-second ordinary-quit timeout during the Russian restart. Owned forced termination and cleanup passed, but that is a failed shutdown gate. Retained evidence: `work/issue-26-multiselect-package/`. A bounded event-instrumented run retains the same timeout/assertions and distinguishes quit phases without claiming a cause from one failure.

## Delivery gates

Public publication requires specific owner permission under [tracker policy](../issue-tracker.md). The repository is public; the recorded #25 exception applies only to #25. No #26 code, checkpoint or issue closure has been published. Exact-SHA platform CI, artifact inspection and integration acceptance remain open; local macOS evidence cannot establish Windows acceptance.
